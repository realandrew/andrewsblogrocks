I don't post much here, but I figured this was worth sharing and reflecting on.

I recently returned from a mission trip to Cuba. This was a lot of firsts for me: first mission trip, first time traveling out of the country (I didn't even have a passport before this trip), and first time flying. But I felt called by the Lord to go, and I'm glad I did - it was an incredible experience, and I'm truly blessed to have had the opportunity to go.

During my time there, I had the privilege of connecting with some of the most resilient, loving, and faithful people I've ever met. I was only there for 7 days, but I now consider many of these people family. We may not be from the same country or even speak the same language, but we worship the same savior, and there is something so powerful in that.

Cuba is going through difficult times; much of the trip was marked by sudden and long-lasting power outages. The country was in a nationwide blackout when we arrived (driving 3 hours in complete darkness is a surreal experience) and then had daily blackouts the entire time we were there. Much of the country struggles with severe food poverty. And Christians in Cuba are continually oppressed and persecuted by the authorities there, as the government wants to be the sole power/authority over its people.

I am humbled by the strength of the Cuban people; despite these and the many other challenges they face daily, they continue to find joy in faith, family, and community. Their passion for worship and service was contagious, and it deepened my understanding of what it means to love and serve selflessly.

My heart is overflowing with gratitude and inspiration. I hope I get the opportunity to return in the future, and in the meantime I will be continually praying for conditions in Cuba to improve.
